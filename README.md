# Groundhog-Day-Aud-Exercise
Choosing the right visualization to convey to audiences is important for conveying the right message. In this exercise, I took one dataset about groundhog day, and created two different visualizations tailored to audiences with different knowledge levels.

### Programs Used ###
- Excel
- Powerbi

### Scope of Work ###
**Deliverables** <br>
- Two visualizations tailored to a general audience and more scientific audience

### Goals ###
This was for my final class at SNHU. I had to design two visualizations that represent two different audience groups using 1 dataset. This project was set in Powerbi, which was great because I don't get a lot of opportunities to wrestle with this widely used visualization program because it isn't as non-paid friendly as Tableau is. <br>

### Data Source ###
This data was provided by the school, but [this website](https://groundhog-day.com/) has a lot of interesting data on the holiday!

## Data viz for General Audiences ##

The general audience is kind of vague, I imagined someone who has never heard of the practice before. So, I tried to tailor the visualization to that while maintaining interesting elements. The green boxes are very simple details that any general audience might want to know. The orange box contains information that can be explored for the audience to come to their own conclusion on the groundhog’s predictions. The large images are designed to capture attention as if it was a flyer of some sort.  

### General Audience Viz Opportunities ###
I think the layout suffered the most here. It's quite busy and there are different font sizes and colorings which can be off-putting to audiences.  <br>

This short choppy redo of the viz reduces unnecessary graphics, adds necessary spacing. And it is already much easier on the eyes. Adding in the context of meteorologists gives nuance to the fantastic nature of the groundhog’s predictions with real world weather people’s takes. Adding an “average February temp” line to the graph would be very helpful context as well. Maybe a call to action to fluff up the bottom area, but the vibe is just already better.  

## Data Viz for Meteorologists ##

Attuned to the weather, I selected a stacked line column graph for a meteorologist to demonstrate temperature trends over time in association with Groundhog Day. Adding a filter for the region would be perfect for a meteorologist to switch between region views. However, just the raw line graph can offer great insight into the data behind each point. In my creation specifically, I included “shadows” to demonstrate the years the groundhog saw his shadow. The superstition would indicate that years when the groundhog saw his shadow, the March and February datapoints would both be showcasing lower temperatures. This chart is a perfect baseline for a meteorologist to examine the science and evidence, or lack thereof, supporting a fuzzy little groundhog’s predictions.

### Data Viz Opportunities for Meteorologist Viz ###
I needed to label “sum of predictions” as “Saw his shadow”. I do really like this chart though, I think having February and March gives more context to the “6 weeks” forecast the groundhog presents. It’s much easier to determine the relationship between the two months and the groundhog prediction. 

## Overall Reflection ##
It was fun repurposing the same dataset to appeal to two different audiences. I think this project truly represents how much the audience matters, as well as many ways data can be represented. I’m proud of both visualizations and I have a lot to learn from them.
